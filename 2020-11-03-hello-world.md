# Hello, world!
I don't know a whole lot about blogging. I don't know how to write to capture an audience, and I'm not sure if there really is any point in doing so. I've read countless blog posts on various topics (most of them related to some technical problem I'm trying to solve in my day-to-day), but I have never really followed a blogging person and haven't really cared about getting in to it myself.

So why am I writing this? Why does this page even exist on the Internet?

At the time I'm writing this, I'm not really sure. I guess I'm kind of interested in the way it works. The writing process, the technical parts of setting up a blog etc. seems interesting enough to try it out at least once. This may be the first and last entry on this page, or it may be the first of many. There's a possibility that the only place this will even be readable is through some web archive because I deleted the site and/or didn't bother to pay the hosting fees (Github Pages will surely not be free of charge forever, right?).

Anyway. To whoever is reading this, welcome!
